                <h4>Check for zeros</h4>
                This code snippet is for finding if there are any <br> zeros within an array.
                <br>
                <br>
                Here we can see that I used it for a limited inventory.
                <br>
                <br>
                We run a for loop from start to finish as long as there are no zeros.
                <br>
                <br>
                If there are any zeros we break the loop because<br> all we were checking for if there were any zeros to begin with.

            <div>
                <h4>Lerp</h4>
                This code snippet is for when I was understanding lerp.
                <br>
                <br>
                Essentially this will make an object go from<br>point A to point B in a linear fashion.
                <br>
                <br>
                In this example I had a plunger object move and not have<br> to check the inner "if" statements if "thrown" was true.
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>Invincibility</h4>
                This code snippet is for when I was handling invincibility<br> and needed a way to indicate that the player was invincible.
                <br>
                <br>
                For this I used an IEnumerator and had<br>the player's sprite flicker after they got hit by an enemy.
                <br>
                <br>
                This lets the player know that after they got hit they have <br> time to get away before getting hit again. 
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>UI Controller</h4>
                This code snippet is for when I needed to display various win conditions,<br> how much money the player had left, and their health.
                <br>
                <br>
                To get the data to correctly display information,<br> I used get and set to gather data from the player.
            </div>

            <div>
                <h4>Pick up item</h4>
                This code snippet is for when I needed to have the player<br> pick up various items and change the slot<br> in their inventory with the correct data.
                <br>
                <br>
                I first check beforehand if there is any space in the inventory<br>using "Check for zeros" and then place<br> the item in the first empty spot available.

            <div>
                <h4>Menu</h4>
                This code snippet is for when I needed have a menu <br>in which the player chooses from a set amount of options.<br>
                <br>
                I used a switch to handle the position of the highlighter,<br> which hovers over the players current option.
                <br>
                <br>
                Depending on what option is highlighter, the player can<br> then press up or down to change it to the next or previous option.

            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Hard coded inventory</h4>
                This code snippet is for when I needed to have<br> an inventory to store the players items.
                <br>
                <br>
                This is a hard coded 2 by 4 inventory,<br> however it can be modified easily within the code.
                <br>
                <br>
                This uses a very similar format as the Menu code.<br>The variable "inventoryCursorPos" is checked<br> by an NPC that is looking for a particular item.
            </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>

            <div>
                <h4>Check the dialogue parameter</h4>
                This code snippet is for when I needed to change an<br> NPC's dialogue based on what has happened in the game so far.
                <br>
                <br>
                Within this code I also can change the item within the players inventory,<br> swapping it with either a new one or nothing.
                <br>
                <br>
                I also have another variation that can take multiple items.

            <div>
                <h4>Patrol nodes</h4>
                This code snippet is for when I needed enemies to<br> walk around in a set pattern going from point A to point B. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Depending on the way the enemy is walking<br>they count the nodes up or down looping back<br> to the beginning and repeating.

            <div>
                <h4>Shoot money (bullets) in cardinal directions</h4>
                This code snippet is for when I needed to let the player<br> shoot money (bullets), count them down and add a delay<br> so they couldn't shoot right away again.
                <br>
                <br>
                Depending on the way the keys pressed the money<br>will shoot a different cardinal direction.
                <br>
                <br>
                I now know how to improve this code,<br> by adding a method to hold the "if" statement<br> that is within the key input statement.<br>Thus, reducing lines and making it easier to read.

            <div>
                <h4>Fill list randomly</h4>
                This code snippet is for when I needed fill two lists,<br>one for strings, one for colors,<br>randomly dependant on the difficulty level.
                <br>
                <br>
                This is for when the player has to choose the correct<br> color in order but not get messed up<br> by the color of the text.

            <div>
                <h4>Choose color coroutine</h4>
                This code snippet is for when I needed to wait<br>for the user input of pressing a color button.
                <br>
                <br>
                It loops through a for loop and if the most recently<br>tapped color is correct it continues<br>until there are no colors left.
                <br>
                <br>
                If the user is correct for every color in the round,<br>the score goes up by one, the lists get empty<br>so they can get a new arrangement,<br>and lastly has a 1 in 3 chance of increasing<br>the amount of colors to memorize for the next round.

                This code snippet is for when check whether or not the <br>last frame the input changed.<br>This is so I can get the most recent three inputs <br>if they have changed within a certain amount of frames,<br> which allows the player to do a quarter circle forward<br> and attack to throw a projectile.
