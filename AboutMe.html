            Hello! I am Spencer Roccapriore.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been playing games since I can remember. <br>The first time I got an intrest in game development was when<br>I was playing one of the original Spyro games for the<br>Playstation.
        </p>
        <p>
            I attended Fitchburg State University for Game Design while<br>minoring in Computer Science. <br>I have been using Unity for 3 years now. <br>The programming languages I am familiar with are C#, Java,<br> and Python. I do know some C and C++.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time I like to play games (go figure), think about <br>possible game mechanics/ideas, and<br>hang out with my friends.
        </p>
