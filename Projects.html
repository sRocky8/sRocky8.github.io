                    <em>Train of Bot</em> is a project I made for my class Advanced Game Workshop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project was made by five people. I was the programmer.
                </p>
                <p>
                   In this project I made an inventory system,<br> made NPCs speak different dialogue<br> based on what has happened in game, and more!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this game you solve puzzles to stop the train<br>because Beep missed his stop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can download and try the game for yourself<br> by going to the Itch.io page below.

                    <em>Inanimate</em> is a project I made for my class 3D Game Development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project was made by four people. I was the programmer.
                </p>
                <p>
                   In this project I learned about raycasting and how to use it,<br> learned about cursor visibility and lock state,<br> and small things like how to use buttons, transition scenes etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this game you walk around town and<br>talk to your neighbors.

                    <em>No 1 is the Enemy</em> is a project I made for the<br>Fitchburg State University fall 2019 game jam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project was made by five people in four days. I was the programmer.
                </p>
                <p>
                   In this project I learned about randomly spawning enemies within<br>a determined area and setting a minimum distance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this game you shoot appraching numbers<br>and rack up points.

                    <em>Read Color</em> is a project I made for fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project was made by just me.
                </p>
                <p>
                   In this project I learned about lists,<br>how to manipulate Unity colors in code, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this game you attempt to press the correct color<br>in the order that was displayed on screen,<br>but the color of the text could try to trick you<br>into pressing the wrong button.

            While this is a small thing, I did make this website and will continue<br>to update it as more and more projects come along and get finished.
            <br>
            <br>
            I learned various html and CSS techniques when building<br>this website, and had very little prior knowledge about making one.
